# sugar-cups

<br>This is not a full project, it's more like a practice for me to be famillier with git and also C.  
The idea is the equation that converts grams into cups( standard cup 240 ml).  
The equation is using density of ingredientes and cup size.

#### First commit:
<br>(12 commits :D still learning & misspelled "sugar"!!)  
simple equation converting grams into cups (only for sugar), header files, working with command line arg  
$ make  
$ ./suger -s 200  
<br>
#### Second commit :
<br>Added Gtk, but now i've a ton of things i don't understand, faced a big problem with Makefile  
Wanted to add other ingredients and make a drop menu but i think this will be the third commit.
